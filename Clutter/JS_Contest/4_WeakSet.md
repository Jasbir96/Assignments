# Title
Store red Flags


## Description 
There’s an array of messages:

```javascript
let messages = [
  {text: "Hello", from: "John"},
  {text: "How goes?", from: "John"},
  {text: "See you soon", from: "Alice"}
];
```
Your code can access it, but the messages are managed by someone else’s code. New messages are added, old ones are removed regularly by that code, and you don’t know the exact moments when it happens.

Now, which data structure could you use to store information about whether the message “has been read”? The structure must be well-suited to give the answer “was it read?” for the given message object.

* When a message is removed from messages, it should disappear from your structure as well.

* We shouldn’t modify message objects, add our properties to them. As they are managed by someone else’s code, that may lead to bad consequences.

## Sample Input:
let messages = [
  {text: "Hello", from: "John"},
  {text: "How goes?", from: "John"},
  {text: "See you soon", from: "Alice"}
];


## Sample Output:
Read message 0: true

## code 
```javascript
let messages = [
  {text: "Hello", from: "John"},
  {text: "How goes?", from: "John"},
  {text: "See you soon", from: "Alice"}
];

let readMessages = new WeakSet();

// two messages have been read
readMessages.add(messages[0]);
readMessages.add(messages[1]);
// readMessages has 2 elements

// ...let's read the first message again!
readMessages.add(messages[0]);
// readMessages still has 2 unique elements

// answer: was the message[0] read?
console.log("Read message 0: " + readMessages.has(messages[0])); // true

messages.shift();
// now readMessages has 1 element (technically memory may be cleaned later)
```
